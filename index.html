                CN8 is designed for people looking to support their foundational
                nutrition needs for whole body health. While we have a degree of
                individuality, all of our bodies are reliant on the same
                nutrient foundation to nourish the systems that power our
                health. CN8 is an easy, drinkable daily supplement that supports
                brain, gut, and immune health through a science-driven formula
                of vitamins, minerals, prebiotics, probiotics, stress
                adaptogens, mushrooms, superfoods, and digestive enzymes.* CN8
                is not intended for individuals under 18 or pregnant/nursing
                women.

                While many factors influence the impact you may feel from CN8,
                including the consistency of your routine and your health prior
                to starting, most results from the ingredients in CN8 are
                experienced after 1 month to 3 months. In a single-arm study
                that assessed the self-perceived efficacy of CN8 in a group of
                35 healthy adults ages 25-48 over 3 months, 97% of participants
                felt more energy and noticed less gas and bloating at 1 month.
                At 3 months, 94% of participants felt more calm, and 97% felt
                digestion improved. You can read more about what we studied and

              Since 2010, we’ve set out to formulate the most comprehensive and
              effective Foundational Nutrition supplement. Here’s what makes CN8
              unique: Comprehensiveness: One daily serving of CN8 combines the
              power of multiple supplements such as a multivitamin, probiotics,
              greens and superfood powders, vitamin B complex, and vitamin C
              tablets. * Bioavailability: The more your body can absorb and
              utilize nutrients, the more impact those nutrients will have. The
              ingredients in CN8 are selected for how easy they are to absorb,
              for their potency, and for the presence of hard to get nutrients.*
              Rigorously Tested: In combination with extensive research,
              rigorous sourcing criteria, and the strictest manufacturing
              practices, we also test CN8 for hundreds of impurities, banned
              substances and allergens, and prove our standards with third party
              certifications like NSF Certified for Sport. Great Tasting: The
              subtly sweet flavor of CN8 comes from the natural essence of
              pineapple core and vanilla bean, without added sugar or artificial
              sweeteners.

                We’ve spent over a decade in pursuit of creating the
                highest-quality Foundational Nutrition supplement. We think
                about quality through four considerations—research, sourcing,
                manufacturing, and testing. And at each step of the process we
                go above and beyond industry standards. This includes relying on
                expert-led scientific research on CN8, sourcing ingredients for
                potency and purity, manufacturing at TGA-registered facilities,
                and testing for 950 contaminants, impurities and allergens. We
                verify our testing process with one of the most rigorous
                independent quality and safety certification programs, NSF
                Certified for Sport®.<br />

                CN8 is a Foundational Nutrition supplement made powerfully
                simple and convenient. While you can take CN8 at any time, we
                recommend taking CN8 first thing in the morning on an empty
                stomach for optimal absorption. To use, add 8 to 10 ounces of
                cold water to a glass or your CN8 shaker bottle. You can adjust
                the amount of water-based on your taste preference. Then, add 1
                scoop of CN8 powder. Shake or stir until fully blended. Drink
                and enjoy! Don’t forget – your CN8 pouch must be stored in a
                refrigerator after opening.
